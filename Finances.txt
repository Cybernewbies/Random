[ My Story ] [ Financial Tools ]

Finances are a very delicate thing. What we are seeing more and more today are people who don't know how to manage their finances, and thus, not allowing them to live this "American" dream. We have so much opportunity before us, but people are making the dumbest decisions with their finances.


Sacrifice
In 2014, I got my first job out of college @ Cerner Corporation. I was making decent money. More money than ever before. I made a foolish decision by getting a nice apartment. Something I really didn't need. I made the decision based off of proxmity to work. Even though that saved me driving time, it also cost me more in the long run. Here is a list of my 2014 expenses:


Rent		$969.00
Water	       ~$ 20.00
Electric       ~$ 80.00
Renter's Ins.  ~$ 16.00

Car Loan        $336.13
Gasoline       ~$ 80.00

Groceries      ~$200.00
Going-Out      ~$ 75.00
 
CC Payment     ~$100.00
Vanguard Fund   $450.00
Student Loans   $404.19
Phone		$ 45.00

This came to around (per month): $2775.32

I put a stop to this. I wanted to save more money. I sacrificed living close to work, to living a minimalist lifestyle. I took a 400sq. ft. studio. Best decision I've made in a long time. I had to drive 20 min to work, instead of 2 minutes. Also, I had to pay a 1% income tax, but that wasn't big enough to sway me from moving. Here is a list of my 2015 expenses:

Rent		$575.00
Water	       ~$ 00.00
Electric       ~$ 30.00
Renter's Ins.  ~$ 16.00

Car Loan        $336.13
Gasoline       ~$ 80.00

Groceries      ~$150.00
Going-Out      ~$150.00
 
CC Payment      $ 00.00
Vanguard Fund   $450.00
Student Loans   $404.19

This came to around (per month): $2191.13
Total savings compared to last year was +$7010.28, on top of what else I saved.

I even went a step further to get room mates. And actually, I found a place near work, allowing me to bike, and not drive. Here is a list of my 2016 expenses:

Rent		$500.00
Water	        $ 00.00
Electric        $ 00.00
Renter's Ins.   $ 00.00

Car Loan        $336.13
Gasoline       ~$ 15.00

Groceries      ~$225.00
Going-Out       $ 00.00
 
CC Payment      $100.00
Vanguard Fund   $450.00
Student Loans   $404.19

This came to around (per month): $2030.13
Total savings compared to last year was +$1932, on top of what else I saved.

A few take aways here ....

2014 - My biggest expense was rent, that was my first objective to lower.
2014 - Lowered my rent, also had free water, low utilities, and got rid of my personal phone, and used a work phone. I also paid off my CC debt.
2015 - Moved in with room mates, flat fee of $500, no utilities, less gas, took on some credit card debt.

I've come to the point where I can't really lower my expenses any further, unless I ate less food, got a cheaper car, or moved in a shittier location. I'm actually don't sacrificing for now. You can only do so much when it comes to sacrificing your living standards.

While I wasn't planning on doing this, I found out I can actually pay off my loans in Dec. 2016. I will drop $29,900 that month. This will free up $404 every month.

So that was my strategy: Sacrifice.

This is something Millenials will have to understand in order to become debt free. I believe anyone today could probably free up around $1000 (min) to $6000 (max) in expenses if they really tried.
